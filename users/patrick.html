            <h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>Hi, this is my page, but you likely already knew that. I'm currently an undergraduate student at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. I am majoring in Computer Science, and hope to obtain minors in Mathematics and Physics. My interests include *NIX like systems, cryptography and cryptographic systems, machine learning algorithms and applications, and applied cybersecurity. I hope to become more involved in CERIAS here at Purdue, and I hope to attend Graduate school after I obtain my B.Sc.</p>
		
            <h3>Relevant Work Experience</h3>
		<p>I've worked at <a href="https://www.ivyhilltech.com/">IvyHill Technologies</a> in New Jersey as an interning applied security reseacher and then as a junior Drupal developer. I plan on continuing my work there over the Summer of 2018.</p>

	    <h3>Computer Science Skills</h3>
		<p>As of Fall 2017, I know basic Python, Java, PyCrypto (a Python2 module that supplies cryptographic primitives), Drupal, Linux, LaTeX, and have a working knowledge of PGP/GPG (see my key below!).</p>
	
	    <h3>Projects</h3>
		<p>The first project I ever did was <a href="https://github.com/synchronizedsynecdoche/Cryptosnake">Cryptosnake</a>, a very small Python script that encrypted a user's string using AES in CBC mode with PBKDF2. I started creating a larger, more ambitious version of it that would fix some issues with the original version (such as not operating on bytes), but I haven't been working on it since school started. I also helped create a website for locating nearby charities at HackBCAIII alongside a group of 5 other people in 24 hours. I worked alongside Chris and Aditya at HackMIT to create ADBlockAR, an application that leverages Microsoft's HoloLens to remove advertisements in real life.</p>

		
	    <h3>Miscellaneous Facts</h3>
<p>I enjoy kayaking and biking in my free time, and casually tutor high schoolers in an online AP Students community (I mainly help with Calculus BC and Computer Science).</p>
            <h3>Contact</h3>
                <p>You can contact me at kelly237@purdue.edu. I would prefer it if you used my <a href="/portfolio/users/content/keys/0xc9189a0e0e6d5443.pub">PGP Key</a> to encrypt emails being sent to that address.</p>
